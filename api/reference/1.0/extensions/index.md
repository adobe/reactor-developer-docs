# Extensions

An `Extension` represents the installed instance of an `ExtensionPackage`. An `Extension` makes the features defined by an `ExtensionPackage` available to the `Property`. These features are leveraged when creating `DataElements` and `RuleComponents`.

An `Extension` belongs to exactly one `Property`. A `Property` can have many `Extensions`, but no more than one installed instance of a given `ExtensionPackage`.

You can read more about `Extensions` in the [Extensions section](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/launch-reference/managing-resources/extensions) of the Launch user docs.
