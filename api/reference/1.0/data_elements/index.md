# DataElements

A `DataElement` functions as a variable which points to an important piece of data within your application.  The data element is used within `Rules` and `Extension` configurations.  When the `Rule` is triggered at run-time in a browser or an application, the value of the `DataElement` is resolved and used within the `Rule`.  They function the same for `Extension` configuration.

Usage of many `DataElements` together make up a data dictionary or data map.  This dictionary represents the data that Launch knows about and can make use of.

A `DataElement` belongs to exactly one `Property`.  A `Property` can have many `DataElements`.

You can read more about `DataElements` in the [Data Elements section](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/reference/manage-resources/data-elements.html) of the Launch user docs.
