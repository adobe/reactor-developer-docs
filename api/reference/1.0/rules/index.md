# Rules

`Rules` control the behavior of the resources in your deployed `Library`.

A `Rule` is really just a group of one or more `RuleComponents` which exists to tie the `RuleComponents` together in a logical way.

A `Rule` belongs to exactly one `Property`.  A `Property` can have many `Rules`.

A `Rule` can have many `RuleComponents`.  A `RuleComponent` belongs to exactly one `Rule`.

You can read more about `Rules` in the [Rules section](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/reference/manage-resources/rules.html) of the Launch user docs.
