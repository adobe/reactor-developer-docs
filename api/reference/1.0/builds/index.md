# Builds

`Extensions`, `Rules`, and `DataElements` are building blocks.  When you want to make your application do something, these building blocks are added to a `Library`. A `Library` is built into a `Build`.

A `Build` is the actual file (or files) that are loaded within your web and mobile applications.  The actual contents of a `Build` will vary based on:
1. The resources included in the `Library`
1. The configuration of the `Environment` to which the `Library` is built
1. The `platform` of the `Property` to which the `Build` belongs

A `Build` belongs to exactly one `Library`.  A `Library` can have many `Builds`.

You can read more about `Builds` in the [Builds section](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/reference/publish/builds.html) of the Launch user docs.
