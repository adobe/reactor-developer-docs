# API First

Launch, by Adobe is an entirely API-first application.  All system functionality is accessible through the API.  The UI at [launch.adobe.com](https://launch.adobe.com) is simply a friendly way to interact with them.

This API - known as the Reactor API - uses the JSON API specification.  We expect inputs to be compliant with this specification and all outputs are also compliant.  You can read more at [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org/).

The full API specification is available under Reference > 1.0 in the navigation.
