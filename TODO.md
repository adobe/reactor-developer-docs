# Docs, Docker, GitHub Actions

## Background

reactor-developer-docs is a Jekyl-based project that builds a documentation
website for the Reactor API. The project is open source, and anyone may
contribute to the project.


## Goals

The CI workflow with Docker Hub is broken. Let's migrate to Github Actions.
The final result should be a deployable Docker image.
