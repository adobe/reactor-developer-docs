## For Customers

Customers already have an Experience Cloud Organization created when contracts are signed. You can use this for extension development.

## For Partners

Partners can have an Experience Cloud Organization created by joining one of Adobe's Partner Programs.

### Exchange Partner Program

This program is for partners who have technology that's complimentary to Adobe and can be integrated with Adobe technologies to add value to our mutual customers. This program maintains a [marketplace](https://www.adobeexchange.com/experiencecloud.html) where partners can create listings that promote their integrations. You can see the registration guide [here](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/reg-guide.html) and you can begin your registration [here](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/prereg.html).

You must be a member of this program in order to create public Launch extensions and listings that will show in the marketplace.

### Solution Partner Program (SPP)

This program is for (1) consulting firms that help Adobe customers make the most of their investments and (2) partners that resell Adobe solutions.  See the registration guide [here](https://spark.adobe.com/page/7PKZzIJJjkcDd/) or begin your registration [here](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/home.html).

{% alert info %}

Solution Partners must also [register](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud/prereg.html) for the Exchange Partner Program as the Exchange agreement contains the terms and conditions for Launch extension development.

Before you complete your Exchange registration, please email the Exchange admin at <ExchangeHelpEC@adobe.com> and explain that you are registering so that you can promote your Launch extension. If you don't do this, they will likely deny your application and suggest you are a better fit for the SPP. 

Currently your corporate email can only be used in one partner program at a time, so you will need to use a different corporate email as the registered contact for each of the programs. It's "sub-optimal", we know. Sorry about that.

{% endalert %}

Once your company is in the Exchange Partner program, you can request access to Adobe Solutions by signing in to the [Exchange Partner Site](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/experiencecloud) and following the steps below. If you already have an Experience Cloud Account and access to solutions, but you don't have access to Launch, please see the instructions for setting up groups and users [here](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/administration/users).
