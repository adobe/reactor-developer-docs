# Extensions Overview

The primary components of an edge extension include the following:

### Condition Types

A rule condition is evaluated after an event has been received at the server level. All conditions must return true in order for the rule to continue processing. The exception is when users explicitly place conditions into an "exception" bucket in which case all conditions within the bucket must return false for the rule to continue processing.

Condition types typically consist of (1) a view shown within the Launch application that allows users to modify settings for the condition and (2) a library module emitted within the Launch runtime library to interpret the settings and evaluate a condition.

### Action Types

A rule action is something that is performed after the rule conditions have passed evaluation.

Action types typically consist of (1) a view shown within the Launch application that allows users to modify settings for the action and (2) a library module emitted within the Launch runtime library to interpret the settings and perform an action.

### Data Element Types

Data elements are essentially aliases to pieces of data regardless of where that data is found inside the event recieved by the server. A data element can be referenced by rules and acts as an abstraction for accessing these pieces of data. When the location of the data changes in the future (for example the event key that contains the value is changed), a single data element can be reconfigured while all the rules referencing that data element can remain unchanged.

Data element types typically consist of (1) a view shown within the Launch application that allows users to modify settings for the data element and (2) a library module emitted within the Launch runtime library to interpret the settings and retrieve pieces of data.

### Extension Configuration

Extension configuration is the manner by which an extension gathers global settings from a user. For example, consider an extension that allows the user to send a beacon using a Send Beacon action and the beacon must always contain an account ID. We don't want to trouble users by asking them for the account ID each time they configure a Send Beacon action. Instead, the extension should ask for the account ID once from the extension configuration view. Each time a beacon is to be sent, the Send Beacon action library module can pull the account ID from the extension configuration and add it to the beacon.

When users install an extension to a Launch property, they will be shown the extension configuration view. They cannot complete installation of the extension without completing extension configuration.

Extension configuration consists of a view component which will export settings that are then emitted within the Launch runtime library as a plain object.

## Extension Structure

An extension consists of a directory of files. An overview of how these files should be structured is as follows. Details on file content can be found in other sections.

An [`extension.json`](reference/extension-manifest) file must exist at the root of the directory. This file will, among other things, describe the makeup of the extension and where certain files are located within the directory. This has some similarities to a [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Each library module (the logic to be emitted within the Launch runtime library) must be its own file whose content follows the [CommonJS module standard](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1). For example, if we're building a "send beacon" action type, we must have a file that contains the logic that sends the beacon. The content of this file will be emitted within the Launch runtime library. You might call it `sendBeacon.js`. The location of the file in the directory is not important since `extension.json` will describe where it is located.

Each view must be an HTML file capable of being loaded into an iframe within the Launch application. The view must include a Launch-provided script and conform to a small API in order to communicate with the Launch application. There are no restrictions as to what libraries are used within your views. In other words, you may use jQuery, Underscore, React, Angular, Bootstrap or other libraries. We do, however, hope that you will make your extension have a similar look and feel to the Launch application.

It is recommended that you put all view-related files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) within a single subdirectory that is isolated from the library module files. In `extension.json` you will describe where this view subdirectory is located. Launch will then serve this subdirectory (and only this subdirectory) from its web servers.
